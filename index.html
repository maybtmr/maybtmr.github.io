    <h1>Meihua Zhou</h1>

    <p>Hello world! My name is Meihua Zhou. I graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School.
        I also majored in software engineering in my high school. For free time, I like to 
        watch anime/movies, hang out with friends, play games and do arts and crafts.
    </p>

    <p>One of my favorite food is sweet and sour pork</p>
